# üçΩÔ∏è Food Delivery App

A full-stack food delivery solution built with React (frontend) and Node.js/Express (backend), featuring secure authentication (JWT, bcrypt), modular hooks, and complete order management logic.

---

## Features

- ‚úÖ User signup/login with secure hashed passwords (`bcrypt`)  
- ‚úÖ JSON Web Token (JWT) based authenticated sessions  
- ‚úÖ Full order workflow: browse menu, cart operations, place orders  
- ‚úÖ Admin endpoints for managing menu and orders  
- ‚úÖ React context & custom hooks for state management & API calls  
- ‚úÖ Responsive UI and clean architecture for easy enhancements

## Tech Stack

| Layer      | Technology         |
|------------|--------------------|
| Frontend   | React, React Router, Axios, Context API |
| Backend    | Node.js, Express, JWT, bcrypt, MongoDB/Mongoose |
| Dev Tools  | ESLint, Prettier, Nodemon |

---

## Architecture Overview

The app consists of two main parts:

- **Backend** (Node.js + Express + MongoDB):  
  - Handles authentication (bcrypt + JWT)  
  - Defines REST APIs for menu, cart, order, and user management  
  - Protects routes with JWT middleware  

- **Frontend** (React):  
  - Uses custom hooks for API interaction and state upkeep  
  - Provides separate screens: Menu, Cart, Orders, Login/Register  
  - Stores auth token in context/localStorage for persistence  

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js & npm  
- MongoDB (local or Atlas)  

### Installation

```bash
# Backend setup
cd backend
npm install
cp .env.example .env
# Fill in environment variables: MONGO_URI, JWT_SECRET, etc.

# Frontend setup
cd ../frontend
npm install
```
## Running the App
```bash

# In one terminal (Backend)
cd backend
npm run dev

# In another terminal (Frontend)
cd frontend
npm start
```
## Backend Overview

### Authentication & Security
üìå Passwords are hashed with bcrypt before saving to MongoDB
üìå Login/signup flows issue JWT tokens
üìå Protected Express routes use middleware to verify JWTs and attach user data


## Frontend Overview

### Custom Hooks

useAuth() ‚Äì Manages login, signup, logout and stores token in context/localStorage

useFetch() ‚Äì A reusable hook using Axios to call API, handles loading and error state

useCart() ‚Äì Handles cart logic: add/remove items, calculate totals, sync with backend

useOrders() ‚Äì Fetches order history and submits new orders
